        <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>This recipe for traditional gyros is adapted for at-home preparation. Pork tenderloin is the main ingredient, and extra softness is achieved by marinating the meat in a blend of herbs, oil, vinegar, and honey. The meat is prepared in a frying pan and served inside a pita bread with tzatziki, onion, and tomato. Tzatziki can be substituted with yogurt or with mustard and mayonnaise sauce.</p>

        <h2>PREPARATION</h2>
        <ol id="steps">
            <li class="prep-step">Step 1/5</li>
            <p>Begin with preparing the pork gyros: cut the tenderloin into thin strips and place them in a large bowl. Add garlic, onion, olive, oil, vinegar, and herbs and combine squeezing with your hands. To finish, add honey, cover the bowl, and place it into the fridge for at least 2 hours, and preferably overnight.</p>
            <li class="prep-step">Step 2/5</li>
            <p>Heat a large, non-sticking pan. Toss in the pork with the entire marinade and sauté for 1 minute without stirring. Then, turn the ingredients on the other side and sauté for another minute, until the meat is browned and crispy on the outside, but still soft and juicy on the inside.</p>
            <li class="prep-step">Step 3/5</li>
            <p>Now, prepare the tzatziki sauce. Pulse olive oil and garlic in a food processor until the garlic is completely smooth and no chunks are left behind. Grate the cucumber, season with salt, and leave for 10 minutes. Now, drain the water out of the cucumber by wrapping it in a towel or a firm kitchen cloth and squeezing it with your hands. Mix cucumber, blended garlic, olive oil, yogurt, vinegar, salt, and pepper, and put in a refrigerator to cool completely.</p>
            <li class="prep-step">Step 4/5</li>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 250°C/480°F. Brush both sides of pita breads with some oil and season them with salt, pepper, and oregano. Bake for 1 minute.</p>
            <li class="prep-step">Step 5/5</li>
            <p>To finish, spread some tzatziki on the pita bread, arrange the gyros on top, and add sliced tomato and onion. If you want to, you can also stuff some fried potatoes and lettuce in the pita bread. Wrap the pita bread like a sandwich and serve.</p>
